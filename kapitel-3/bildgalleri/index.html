            <h3>Astronaut Harrison Schmitt Collects Lunar Rake Samples</h3>
            <p>Scientist-astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt, lunar module pilot, collects lunar rake samples at Station 1
                during the first Apollo 17 extravehicular activity (EVA) at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. This
                picture was taken by astronaut Eugene Cernan, commander
                . The lunar rake, an Apollo lunar geology hand tool, is
                used to collect discrete samples of rocks and rock chips ranging in size from one-half inch
                (1.3 centimeter) to one inch (2.5 centimeter).</p>

        <p>Apollo Astronaut James B. Irwin, lunar module pilot, works at the Lunar Roving Vehicle during the
            first Apollo 15 lunar surface extravehicular activity (EVA) at
            the Hadley-Apennine landing site. The shadow of the Lunar Module "Falcon" is in the foreground. This view is
            looking northeast, with Mount Hadley in the background.

        <h3>Saturn Apollo Program</h3>
        <p>The second manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 12 launched from launch pad 39-A at Kennedy Space Center in
            Florida on November 14, 1969 via a Saturn Five launch vehicle.
            The Saturn V vehicle was developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) under the direction of Dr.
            Wernher von Braun. Aboard Apollo 12 was a crew of three astronauts: Alan L. Bean, pilot of the Lunar Module
            (LM), Intrepid; Richard Gordon, pilot of the Command Module (CM), Yankee Clipper; and Spacecraft Commander
            Charles Conrad. The LM, Intrepid, landed astronauts Conrad and Bean on the lunar surface in what’s known as
            the Ocean of Storms while astronaut Richard Gordon piloted the CM, Yankee Clipper, in a parking orbit around
            the Moon. Their lunar soil activities included the deployment of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments
            Package (ALSEP), finding the unmanned Surveyor 3 that landed on the Moon on April 19, 1967, and collecting
            75 pounds (34 kilograms) of rock samples. In this photograph, one of the astronauts on the Moon’s surface is
            holding a container of lunar soil.
            The other astronaut is seen reflected in his helmet. Apollo 12 safely returned to Earth on November 24,
            1969.</p>

        <h3>Astronaut Harrison Schmitt standing next to boulder during third EVA</h3>
        <p>AS17-146-22294 (13 Dec. 1972) --- Scientist-astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt is photographed working beside a
            huge boulder at Station 6 (base of North Massif)
            during the third Apollo 17 extravehicular activity (EVA) at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. The front
            portion of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is visible on the left. This picture was taken by astronaut Eugene
            A. Cernan, Apollo 17 commander. Schmitt is the lunar module pilot. While astronauts Cernan and Schmitt
            descended in the Lunar Module (LM) "Challenger" to explore the moon, astronaut Ronald E.
            Evans, command module pilot, remained with the Apollo 17 Command and Service Modules (CSM) in lunar orbit.
