    <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
    <p>"All You Need Is Love" is a song by t
        he English rock band the Beatles that was released as a
        non-album single in July 1967, with "Baby, You're a Rich Man" as its B-side. It was
        written by John Lennon[4] and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Bri
        tain's contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for whi
        ch the band were filmed performing it a
        t EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and s
        een by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countrie
        s. Lennon's lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show's internati
        onal audience, and captured the utopian ideals a
        ssociated with the Su
        mmer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other
        countries, and became an anthem for
        the counterculture's embrace of flower power philosophy.</p>
    <p>Our World coincided with the height of the Beatles' popularity and influence, following the
        release of their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Rather than perform the song en
        tirely live, the group played to a pre-recorded backing track. With an orchestral arrangement by George
        Martin, the song begins with a portion of the French national anthem and ends with musical quotations from works
        such as Glenn
        Miller's "In the Mood", "Greensleeves", Bach's Invention No. 8 in F major, and the Beatles' 1963 hit "She Loves
        You". Adding to the broadcast's festive atmosphere
        , the studio was adorned with signs and streamers and filled with guests dressed in psychedelic attire, inclu
        ding members of the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Small
        Faces. Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, described the performance as the band's "finest" moment.</p>
